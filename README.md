# BMI Calculator (Java)

## 📌 Description

This is a simple **Java console application** that calculates a person's **Body Mass Index (BMI)** using their **height (in inches)** and **weight (in pounds)**. Based on the calculated BMI value, the program classifies the person as **Underweight, Healthy weight, Overweight, or Obese**.

## 📂 Package Information

* **Package Name:** `day3`
* **Class Name:** `BMICal`

## 🧮 Formula Used

The BMI is calculated using the standard formula for pounds and inches:

```
BMI = (weight / (height * height)) * 703
```
